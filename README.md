# Loop Assignment

This project was completed as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** training, organized by the **Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT)**.  
It focuses on practicing Python loop structures and working with different data types to perform data processing tasks.

## Approach
- Used **for loops** to iterate over data and extract specific values.
- Applied **if-else** conditions within loops to filter and process data.
- Worked with multiple Python data structures:
  - **List** – to store sequences of data.
  - **Dictionary** – to store data as key-value pairs.
  - **Set** – to store unique values and avoid duplicates.
- Stored processed results for further use.
- Printed final outputs in a clear, readable format.

## Tools Used
- **Python** – core programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development environment
